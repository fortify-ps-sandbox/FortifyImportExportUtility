# Fortify Vulnerability Exporter

## Introduction

This is work in progress. 

At the moment this utility provides just a prototype of how to wire various components
together; it doesn't do anything useful yet.

## Developers

The following sections provide information that may be useful for developers of this utility.

### IDE's

This project uses Lombok. In order to have your IDE compile this project without errors, 
you may need to add Lombok support to your IDE. Please see https://projectlombok.org/setup/overview 
for more information.

### Gradle Wrapper

It is strongly recommended to build this project using the included Gradle Wrapper
scripts; using other Gradle versions may result in build errors and other issues.

The Gradle build uses various helper scripts from https://github.com/fortify-ps/gradle-helpers;
please refer to the documentation and comments in included scripts for more information. 

### Common Commands

All commands listed below use Linux/bash notation; adjust accordingly if you
are running on a different platform. All commands are to be executed from
the main project directory.

* `./gradlew tasks --all`: List all available tasks
* Build: (plugin binary will be stored in `build/libs`)
	* `./gradlew clean build`: Clean and build the project
	* `./gradlew build`: Build the project without cleaning
	* `./gradlew dist`: Build distribution zip
* Version management:
	* `./gradlew printProjectVersion`: Print the current version
	* `./gradlew startSnapshotBranch -PnextVersion=2.0`: Start a new snapshot branch for an upcoming `2.0` version
	* `./gradlew releaseSnapshot`: Merge the changes from the current branch to the master branch, and create release tag
* `./fortify-scan.sh`: Run a Fortify scan; requires Fortify SCA to be installed

Note that the version management tasks operate only on the local repository; you will need to manually
push any changes (including tags and branches) to the remote repository.

### Versioning

The various version-related Gradle tasks assume the following versioning methodology:

* The `master` branch is only used for creating tagged release versions
* A branch named `<version>-SNAPSHOT` contains the current snapshot state for the upcoming release
* Optionally, other branches can be used to develop individual features, perform bug fixes, ...
	* However, note that the Gradle build may be unable to identify a correct version number for the project
	* As such, only builds from tagged versions or from a `<version>-SNAPSHOT` branch should be published to a Maven repository

### CI/CD

Travis-CI builds are automatically triggered when there is any change in the project repository,
for example due to pushing changes, or creating tags or branches. If applicable, binaries and related 
artifacts are automatically published to Bintray using the `bintrayUpload` task:

* Building a tagged version will result in corresponding release version artifacts to be published
* Building a branch named `<version>-SNAPSHOT` will result in corresponding beta version artifacts to be published
* No artifacts will be deployed for any other build, for example when Travis-CI builds the `master` branch

See the [Related Links](#related-links) section for the relevant Travis-CI and Bintray links.
